# Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry communication kit

This repository is used to store and maintain all the materials related to
external communications from Software and Data Carpentry.

It meant to be used by all members of Software and Data Carpentry. 

The goal of this repository not to be an archive of past communications, but to
provide reusable pieces of text that simplify and standarize the exchange of
information between Software and Data Carpentry and the outside world.

## Repository organization

The repository is organized by whom the materials are addressed to. See the
